Here are the five essential characteristics of cloud computing as defined by NIST, each with an Azure cost example:

*   **On-Demand Self-Service**: This characteristic allows consumers to unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, automatically as needed, without requiring human interaction with each service provider.
    *   **Azure Cost Example**: A developer can instantly spin up an Azure Virtual Machine or a new database instance through the Azure portal without any human intervention from Microsoft, and they are billed only for the time those resources are active, eliminating the need for manual approval processes or delays that could add to project labor costs.

*   **Broad Network Access**: Cloud capabilities are available over the network and can be accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms, such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations.
    *   **Azure Cost Example**: An application hosted in Azure can be accessed by users globally from any device with an internet connection. Costs related to this are primarily incurred for data egress (data leaving Azure data centers) to the user's location, rather than needing to replicate infrastructure in every geographical area.

*   **Resource Pooling (Multi-tenancy)**: The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model. Different physical and virtual resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand, providing economies of scale. Consumers generally have no control or knowledge over the exact physical location of resources.
    *   **Azure Cost Example**: Azure hosts numerous customers on shared underlying hardware, optimizing resource utilization. This efficiency allows Azure to offer services at more affordable "pay-as-you-go" rates because the cost of the physical infrastructure is distributed among many tenants, reducing the per-user cost compared to dedicated hardware.

*   **Rapid Elasticity**: Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, sometimes automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be appropriated at any time.
    *   **Azure Cost Example**: During a marketing campaign, an Azure App Service automatically scales out to handle increased web traffic by adding more compute instances. Users only pay for these additional instances during the period of high demand. Once traffic subsides, the service scales back in, reducing costs automatically to match the lower consumption.

*   **Measured Service**: Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage is monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service. This is typically done on a pay-per-use basis.
    *   **Azure Cost Example**: Azure bills customers based on precise usage metrics, such as gigabytes of storage consumed, hours of virtual machine uptime, or gigabytes of data transferred. This "pay-as-you-go" model ensures that costs directly reflect actual consumption, offering transparency and allowing businesses to manage their spending effectively.
