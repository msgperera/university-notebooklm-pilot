According to the NIST definition, cloud computing is characterized by five essential characteristics:

*   **On-demand self-service**: Consumers can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.
*   **Broad network access**: Capabilities are available over the network and can be accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms, such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations.
*   **Resource pooling**: The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model. Different physical and virtual resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand, creating a sense of location independence where the customer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact physical location of the resources but may specify location at a higher abstraction level (e.g., country, state, or datacenter). Examples of these resources include storage, processing, memory, and network bandwidth.
*   **Rapid elasticity**: Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, sometimes automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the available capabilities for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.
*   **Measured service**: Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service, typically on a pay-per-use or charge-per-use basis.

It is also noted that a sixth characteristic, **Resiliency**, is sometimes considered, though it is not part of the original NIST specification.
