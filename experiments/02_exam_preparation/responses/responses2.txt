According to the NIST definition, **Measured Service** is one of the five essential characteristics of cloud computing. It states that cloud systems automatically **control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability** at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). This characteristic ensures that **resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer** of the utilized service, typically on a **pay-per-use or charge-per-use basis**. The concept of "pay as you go" is central to the economics of cloud computing, making computational and storage power available at affordable rates.

Here are examples from the workshops illustrating the concept of Measured Service in Azure:

*   **Azure Blob Storage for Static Websites**: In the "BUS5001-Workshop-Azure-Host-StaticSite-Wk4.pdf," when creating a storage account for hosting a static website, you select specific configurations like "Standard" for performance and "Geo-redundant storage (GRS)" for redundancy. These choices directly influence the cost, as different storage types and redundancy levels have varying billing implications. Blob storage itself is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data, and its usage (e.g., amount of data stored, operations performed) would be metered and charged accordingly. The workshop also explicitly advises users to **"Clean up all the Azure resources used after the completion of the workshop... to prevent unnecessary cost"**, directly reflecting the pay-per-use model.

*   **Azure Logic Apps for Workflow Automation**: The workshops on Azure Logic Apps ("BUS5001-Workshop-Wk03.pdf" and "BUS5001-Workshop-Wk04-WorlflowAutomation.pdf") involve automating tasks like parsing CSV files or saving email attachments. Logic Apps are a cloud service where consumption is typically metered based on factors such as the number of workflow executions, actions performed, and data processed. Just like with Blob Storage, the importance of **cleaning up resources to prevent unnecessary cost** after completing the workshop is emphasized, highlighting the measured service aspect where you pay for what you consume.

*   **Azure Static Web App with GitHub Actions**: In the "BUS5001-Workshop-Wk5-2 (1).pdf," when creating an Azure Static Web App, one of the properties specified is the "Plan type," which is set to **"Free: For hobby or personal projects"**. While this is a free tier, it still represents a form of measured service where the provider offers a specific level of service (or a capped amount of resources) without charge, with higher tiers likely involving metered billing. The consistent instruction to **"Clean up all the Azure resources used after the completion of the workshop. Storage account, Resource group, etc. to prevent unnecessary cost"** reinforces that even outside the free tier, Azure services are generally billed based on their usage.

These examples illustrate that in cloud computing, you are charged based on your consumption of resources, whether it's storage, processing power, network bandwidth, or application executions, providing transparency and aligning cost directly with utilization.
