Here's a comparison table synthesizing how Azure services in the BUS5001 workshops (Week 3: Logic Apps, Week 4: Blob Storage, Week 5: Static Web Apps) implement NIST's five essential cloud characteristics:

| Characteristic | NIST Definition | Azure Workshop Example | Real-world Implication for Exams |
| :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **On-Demand Self-Service** | Consumer can **unilaterally provision computing capabilities** (e.g., server time, storage) automatically without human interaction with the service provider. | Users **create Azure Storage accounts** and **Logic App resources** instantly via the portal, without manual provider intervention. | This characteristic demonstrates **agility**; enables rapid provisioning of IT resources for projects, reducing setup delays and dependence on IT staff. |
| **Broad Network Access** | Capabilities are **available over the network** and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, laptops). | A **static website hosted on Azure Blob Storage** is publicly accessible via a URL from any web browser or internet-connected device. | Highlights **global accessibility**; allows applications to reach users anywhere, essential for distributed teams and worldwide customer bases. |
| **Resource Pooling** | Provider's computing resources are **pooled to serve multiple consumers** using a multi-tenant model, with resources dynamically assigned and reassigned. | Azure Blob Storage and Logic Apps operate on **shared underlying Azure infrastructure**, where customers generally have no control or knowledge over physical location. | Explains **cost efficiency and economies of scale** in cloud computing, as the infrastructure costs are distributed among many different tenants. |
| **Rapid Elasticity** | Capabilities can be **elastically provisioned and released**, sometimes automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. | An Azure Static Web App or Logic App workflow is designed to **dynamically adjust resources** to handle varying loads (e.g., website traffic, email volume), providing the appearance of unlimited capabilities. | Supports **unpredictable workloads**; ensures application performance during traffic spikes and cost optimization during lulls, preventing over-provisioning. |
| **Measured Service** | Cloud systems automatically **control and optimize resource use** by leveraging a metering capability; resource usage is monitored, controlled, and reported for transparency. | Azure bills customers based on precise usage metrics for **Blob Storage capacity** or **Logic App executions**, ensuring transparency and pay-per-use billing. | Enables **transparent cost management and optimization**; allows businesses to align IT spending directly with actual consumption and forecast expenses. |
