### Prompt: "According to the NIST definition in the uploaded PDF, what are the 5 essential characteristics of cloud computing? Cite specific sections."

**Output**: [response1.txt], [Screenshot1.png]
**Accuracy assessment and Usefulness**:

- Accuracy Assurance: Direct quotes from NIST eliminate misinterpretation risk.
- Time Savings: 5-minute query replaces 30+ minutes of manual PDF searching.
- Citation Ready: Pre-formatted references meet academic integrity requirements.


### Prompt: "Explain 'Measured Service' from the NIST definition using Azure cost examples from the workshops."

**Output**: [response2.txt], [Screenshot2.png]
**Accuracy assessment and Usefulness**:

- Exam Prep: Adds output to flashcards with highlighted cost examples.
- Assignment Draft: Uses citations in a paper on cloud cost models.
- Lab Report: References Azure billing screenshots alongside NotebookLM output.
- Time Savings: 30 sec query replaces 15/20 mins of manual PDF searching.
- Citation Ready: Auto-generated references meet academic integrity requirements.


### Prompt: "Summarize the 5 NIST cloud characteristics with 1 Azure cost example each. Format as a bulleted list with <100 words per characteristic. Include source citations."

**Output**: [response3.txt], [Screenshot3.png]
**Accuracy assessment and Usefulness**:

- Accuracy Assurance: Direct quotes from NIST eliminate misinterpretation risk.
- Time Savings: 5-minute query replaces 30+ minutes of manual PDF searching.
- Citation Ready: Pre-formatted references meet academic integrity requirements.

**Outcome**:
*Student enters exam with precise, source-backed answers for 20% of the test questions.*

**Multi-Document Synthesis for Exam Preparation**:
### Prompt: "Synthesize how Azure services in Wk3 (Logic Apps), Wk4 (Blob Storage), and Wk5 (Static Web Apps) implement NIST's 5 cloud characteristics.  
Format as a comparison table with:  
1. NIST definition (cite page)  
2. Azure workshop example (cite step)  
3. Real-world implication for exams.  
Keep each row ≤ 2 lines." 

**Output**: [response4.txt], [Screenshot4.png]
**Accuracy assessment and Usefulness**:

- Accuracy Assurance: Cross-verifies NIST theory with Azure practice.
- Time Savings: 7-minute table replaces 2+ hours of manual synthesis.
- Citation Ready: Auto-cites NIST + specific workshop steps.

**Outcome**:
*Student can answer 90% of cloud implementation questions using this synthesized table.*


### **RBAC in Azure (Linked from Personal Notes)**  

### Prompt: ""Link this note to RBAC examples in the Governance/Security documents.  
Include:  
1. Azure implementation steps  
2. Screenshot-worthy UI locations  
3. Exam-relevant security tradeoffs."

**Output**: [response5.txt], [Screenshot5.png]

1. **Workshop Implementation**  
   - **Wk5 (Governance):**  
     - Step 19: "Assign 'Reader' role to team members" in Azure Portal IAM  
     - UI Path: `Storage Account → Access Control (IAM) → Add Role Assignment`  
   - **Wk4 (Security):**  
     - Page 18: Diagram of RBAC roles (Owner vs Contributor)  

2. **Exam Relevance**  
   - **Pro:** Minimizes attack surface (least privilege)  
   - **Con:** Role explosion risk (cite Wk4 p.19 "Custom Roles")  

3. **Key Screenshot**
